    <div class="text"></div><p>Clarice Starling is a top student at the FBIâ€™s training academy. Jack Crawford wants Clarice to interview 
    Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for 
    various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case and that 
    Starling, as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to draw him out. </p>
