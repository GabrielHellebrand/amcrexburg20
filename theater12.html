    <div class="text"><p>On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his 
    computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his 
    dorm room as a small site among friends soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. 
    A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in historyâ€¦ 
    but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications. </p>
